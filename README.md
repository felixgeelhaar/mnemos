# Mnemos

**The local-first evidence layer that grounds AI in truth.**

Your RAG system hallucinates because your data layer has no concept of evidence or contradiction. Mnemos fixes the data layer — every claim traces to its source, and conflicting information is surfaced instead of buried.

## The Problem

```
$67.4B — the annual cost of AI hallucination (2026)
51% — of enterprise AI responses contain fabrications on RAG data
52% — of organizations report significant negative consequences from AI inaccuracies
```

RAG alone reduces hallucination by 40-71%. But RAG on ungoverned data? 52% fabrication rate. The problem isn't the model—it's the data layer.

**"Confident wrong answers" are worse than uncertain ones.** Users don't verify cited outputs.

## 5-Minute Quickstart

### 1. Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux (Homebrew)
brew tap felixgeelhaar/tap && brew install mnemos

# Go (any platform with Go 1.25+)
go install github.com/felixgeelhaar/mnemos/cmd/mnemos@latest
go install github.com/felixgeelhaar/mnemos/cmd/mnemos@latest

# Docker
docker run --rm ghcr.io/felixgeelhaar/mnemos --version

# From source
git clone https://github.com/felixgeelhaar/mnemos.git && cd mnemos && make install
```

### 2. Process text — extract claims and detect contradictions

```bash
mnemos process --text "The deployment succeeded in production. The deployment did not succeed in production. Response times averaged 45ms."
```

Mnemos extracts three claims, detects the contradiction between the first two, and flags them as contested.

### 3. Query with evidence

```bash
mnemos query "What happened with the deployment?"
```

The answer comes with the source claims, confidence scores, and surfaced contradictions — so you know what's true and what's contested.

### 4. Try with your own documents

```bash
mnemos process meeting-notes.md
mnemos query "What decisions were made?"
```

No API keys required — rule-based extraction and contradiction detection work out of the box.

### Recommended: Add an LLM provider for best results

For querying real documents, set up an LLM provider. This enables semantic search, better extraction, and grounded answers:

```bash
export MNEMOS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai   # or: anthropic, gemini, ollama, openai-compat
export MNEMOS_LLM_API_KEY=sk-...

# LLM extraction + embeddings + grounded query answers
mnemos process --llm --embed meeting-notes.md
mnemos query --llm "What decisions were made?"
```

Without a provider, extraction and contradiction detection still work via rule-based heuristics. Queries use BM25 keyword matching, which works well for simple questions but may miss nuance on longer documents.

### Optional: MCP server for AI agents

```bash
mnemos mcp   # Exposes query_knowledge, process_text, and knowledge_metrics over stdio
```

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Ingest   │ -> │  Extract    │ -> │   Relate    │ -> │    Query    │
│  (events)  │    │  (claims)   │    │ (evidence)  │    │   (truth)   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

**Extract** — Turns raw text into structured claims (facts, decisions, hypotheses)
**Relate** — Detects support and contradiction relationships between claims
**Query** — Returns answers with claims, evidence, and surfaced contradictions

## Example Output

```json
{
  "answer": "Tech stack decisions show contradiction: PostgreSQL vs MySQL",
  "claims": [
    {"text": "We decided to use PostgreSQL", "type": "decision", "confidence": 0.88},
    {"text": "The team prefers MySQL", "type": "fact", "confidence": 0.75}
  ],
  "contradictions": [
    {"from": "claim-1", "to": "claim-2", "type": "contradicts"}
  ]
}
```

## Why Mnemos?

| | Traditional RAG | Mnemos |
|---|---|---|
| Claims traced to evidence | ❌ | ✅ |
| Contradictions surfaced | ❌ | ✅ |
| Local-first / private | ❌ | ✅ |
| Grounded in governed data | ❌ | ✅ |
| Evolves over time | ❌ | ✅ |

## Key Features

- **Evidence-backed claims** — Every extracted claim maps to source material
- **Contradiction detection** — Automatically surface conflicting information
- **Local-first** — Your data stays on your machine (`~/.local/share/mnemos/`)
- **Multi-provider extraction** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Developer-friendly** — CLI-first, JSON output, MCP-ready, pipeline-friendly

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mnemos process <path or --text>` | Ingest + extract + relate in one step |
| `mnemos process --llm --text <text>` | Use LLM-backed extraction |
| `mnemos ingest <file>` | Ingest document as events |
| `mnemos extract --run <run-id>` | Extract claims from a run's events |
| `mnemos relate` | Detect relationships between claims |
| `mnemos query <question>` | Query with evidence |
| `mnemos query --hops <N> <question>` | Expand result claims by N supports/contradicts hops (max 5) |
| `mnemos query --llm <question>` | Query with LLM-grounded answer generation |
| `mnemos metrics` | Knowledge base statistics |
| `mnemos audit [--include-embeddings]` | Export the full knowledge base as JSON for compliance/backup |
| `mnemos resolve <winner> --over <loser> [--reason "..."]` | Resolve a contradiction: winner → resolved, loser → deprecated |

### Claim lifecycle

Every claim carries a status: `active`, `contested`, `resolved`, or `deprecated`. Status changes are recorded in `claim_status_history` (from, to, when, why) so the lifecycle of every claim is auditable. When a query surfaces a claim whose status changed at some point, the answer text includes an `Evolution:` line summarizing the timeline — e.g. _"Transitioned from contested to resolved on 2026-04-18 (evidence review by jane)."_
| `mnemos mcp` | Start MCP server over stdio |
| `mnemos serve [--port N]` | Start HTTP registry server (default `:7777`) |
| `mnemos registry connect <url>` | Wire this project to a remote registry |
| `mnemos push` | Send local knowledge to the registry |
| `mnemos pull` | Fetch knowledge from the registry into the local DB |

### HTTP Registry (Phase 2B)

`mnemos serve` exposes the local knowledge base as a small HTTP API so other tools, dashboards, or scripts can read and write without speaking SQLite. Cross-project federation and namespace scoping land in subsequent commits.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | Liveness probe + version |
| `/v1/events` | GET | List events (`?limit`, `?offset`) |
| `/v1/events` | POST | Append a batch of events |
| `/v1/claims` | GET | List claims (`?type=fact\|hypothesis\|decision`, `?status=active\|contested\|resolved\|deprecated`, `?limit`, `?offset`) |
| `/v1/claims` | POST | Upsert a batch of claims (with optional `evidence` links) |
| `/v1/relationships` | GET | List relationships (`?type=supports\|contradicts`, `?limit`, `?offset`) |
| `/v1/relationships` | POST | Upsert a batch of relationships |
| `/v1/embeddings` | GET | List embeddings (`?entity_type=event\|claim`, `?limit`, `?offset`) |
| `/v1/embeddings` | POST | Upsert a batch of embeddings (vector as JSON float array) |
| `/v1/metrics` | GET | Counts mirroring `mnemos metrics` |

Defaults: `limit=50`, capped at `200`. Port also accepts `MNEMOS_SERVE_PORT`. Request bodies cap at 5 MB.

**Web UI.** `mnemos serve` also serves a minimal single-page UI at `GET /`. It renders the metrics, paginated claims (with type/status filters), and the contradiction list by hitting the same `/v1/*` endpoints above. The HTML is embedded via `//go:embed` so there's no separate deploy step — one binary, one port.

**Authentication.** Set `MNEMOS_REGISTRY_TOKEN=<your-secret>` to require `Authorization: Bearer <your-secret>` on all write methods (POST/PUT/DELETE). Reads stay open by default — useful for browse-only dashboards. When the env var is unset, the registry is fully open (suitable for local dev and trusted networks).

### Integrating Mnemos in your app

The HTTP API at `mnemos serve` is the integration surface. Three flavors:

**Go (typed client)** — `import "github.com/felixgeelhaar/mnemos/client"`:

```go
c := client.New("http://localhost:7777",
    client.WithToken("optional-secret"),
    client.WithLogger(logger),               // *bolt.Logger
    client.WithRetry(retry.Config{           // fortify retry; 5xx + 429 retry, 4xx fail fast
        MaxAttempts:   3,
        InitialDelay:  200 * time.Millisecond,
        MaxDelay:      time.Second,
        BackoffPolicy: retry.BackoffExponential,
        Jitter:        true,
    }),
)

// Write
c.Events().Append(ctx, []client.Event{{
    ID: "ev_1", RunID: "session-A", SchemaVersion: "v1",
    Content: "We chose Postgres for the new service",
    SourceInputID: "src_1", Timestamp: client.FormatTime(time.Now()),
}})

// Read with chained filters
list, _ := c.Claims().Type("decision").Status("active").Limit(25).List(ctx)
for _, claim := range list.Claims {
    fmt.Printf("[%s] %s\n", claim.Type, claim.Text)
}
```

Resource accessors (`Events()`, `Claims()`, `Relationships()`, `Embeddings()`) return fluent builders. Filter methods chain; terminal `List(ctx)` reads, `Append(ctx, ...)` writes. Non-2xx responses return `*client.APIError` with the server's status and message; works with `errors.As`. Built-in `bolt` request logging and `fortify` retry-with-backoff. Safe for concurrent use.

**Any other language (curl)**:

```bash
# Append an event
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/v1/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <optional-token>' \
  -d '{"events":[{"id":"ev_1","content":"...","timestamp":"2026-04-19T10:00:00Z"}]}'

# Browse claims, filtered
curl 'http://localhost:7777/v1/claims?type=decision&limit=25'
```

**Python (stdlib)**:

```python
import json, urllib.request

req = urllib.request.Request(
    "http://localhost:7777/v1/events",
    data=json.dumps({"events": [{"id": "ev_1", "content": "...", "timestamp": "2026-04-19T10:00:00Z"}]}).encode(),
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"},
)
urllib.request.urlopen(req)
```

For an AI agent: skip the HTTP API entirely and use the MCP transport (`mnemos mcp`). Agents that speak MCP get the same surface plus `query_knowledge`, `process_text`, browsing, file watching, and git ingestion already wired up.

### Push / Pull

Once a project is connected to a registry, knowledge flows like git:

```bash
mnemos registry connect https://registry.example.com --token <secret>
mnemos push                       # send local events/claims/relationships
mnemos pull                       # fetch remote knowledge into the local DB
```

`registry connect` writes `.mnemos/config.json`. Resolution precedence for `push`/`pull` is **CLI flags (`--url`, `--token`) > env vars (`MNEMOS_REGISTRY_URL`, `MNEMOS_REGISTRY_TOKEN`) > config file**, so CI can override per-job without editing the file.

Sync is idempotent — IDs are the dedup key, so running `push`/`pull` twice is safe. Vectors transfer too: embeddings ride on the same wire as JSON float arrays and round-trip bit-exact, so semantic ranking on pulled content works without re-embedding. Claim-evidence links travel with the claims so the local query engine can resolve pulled claims back to their source events.

**Federation provenance.** Pulled events get stamped with `pulled_from_registry: <url>` in their metadata. The query engine surfaces this in the answer text — claims sourced from a registry appear as `… (from https://reg.example.com)` and the summary line counts them: `Context used 5 event(s) and 8 claim(s) (3 from a connected registry).` Local claims are unmarked (the no-registry case stays uncluttered). The `claim_provenance` field on the MCP `query_knowledge` response carries the same map programmatically.
